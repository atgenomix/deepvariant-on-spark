How to contribute to DeepVariant-on-Spark
=========================================

Thank you in advance for contributing to DeepVariant-on-Spark!

You can just let your code do the talking for you if you like.

### Search the Github issue tracker and pull requests

Before you write too much code, check the [open issues in the
DeepVariant-on-Spark issue tracker](https://github.com/atgenomix/deepvariant-on-spark/issues?state=open)
and [DeepVariant-on-Spark open pull requests](https://github.com/atgenomix/deepvariant-on-spark/pulls)
to see if someone else is already working on it. If the issue is a new
one, and you have already written the code to address the issue, simply
[submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
If you haven't written any code but plan to, go ahead and
[open a new issue](https://github.com/atgenomix/deepvariant-on-spark/issues/new)
and assign it to yourself to socialize your work. When you submit your
PR, please reference this pull request so that it will be automatically
closed when the PR is merged.

The issue tracker has a list of ["pick me up!"](https://github.com/atgenomix/deepvariant-on-spark/issues?labels=pick+me+up%21&page=1&state=open) issues
that are good tasks to help you get familiar with DeepVariant-on-Spark;
they don't require an understanding of genomics and are fairly limited
in scope.
